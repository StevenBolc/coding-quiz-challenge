Coding quiz challenge
i first started with simple html and css, after a few days in the class, we learned new ways of js implementation and bootstrap useage. i scrapped the previous code and went with bootstrap.
i then added variables and functions to the javascript files. once everything was running slightly better, i started working on adding the CSS and fixing margins.
i used an array in a seperate js file to keep the code looking clean
